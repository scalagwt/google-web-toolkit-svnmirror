<h1>Web App Classpath Problem</h1>

<p>You were directed to this doc because your server code needed a class or
resource that was not found on <i>web app classpath</i>, but <b>was</b> found
on the <i>system classpath</i>. The <i>system classpath</i> is the classpath
you specify when launching the Java VM to run hosted mode.  The <i>web app
classpath</i> is different-- it consists of classes that live in your web
application's <i>war directory</i>.  All server classes and dependencies should
to be placed in your war directory-- libraries (jars) should be placed in
<code>war/WEB-INF/lib/</code>; classes that don't live in jars should be placed
in <code>war/WEB-INF/classes/</code>.

<p>GWT hosted mode helpfully works around this problem by mapping these outside
resources into your web app classpath.  A warning is issued because failing to
address the issue can lead to problems when you actually deploy your web app to
a real server.</p>

<h2>Tips</h2>

<ul>
<li>The most common reason to encounter this problem with a new project is
trying to load <code>com.google.gwt.user.client.rpc.RemoteService</code>. The
solution to is copy <code>gwt-servlet.jar</code> from the GWT install directory
into your web app's <code>war/WEB-INF/lib/</code> directory.</li>
<li>If you have a good reason for not following the recommended configuration,
you can suppress warning by setting the Java system property
<code>gwt.nowarn.webapp.classpath</code>.  Specify
<code>-Dgwt.nowarn.webapp.classpath</code> as a JVM argument when launching
hosted mode.
</li>
