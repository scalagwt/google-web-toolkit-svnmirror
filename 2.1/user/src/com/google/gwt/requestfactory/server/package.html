Server side classes for mediating between the client side and the persistent datastore.

This package contains classes that can receive client side read and write requests in the JSON format, perform the necessary operations on the persistent datastore, and return the results in JSON format.
<p><span style="color:red">Experimental API: All classes in this package are still under rapid development, and are very likely to be deleted or renamed. Use them at your own risk.
