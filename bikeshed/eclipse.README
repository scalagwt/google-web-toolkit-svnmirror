To create a Bikeshed project in Eclipse:

* Set your source code control system (e.g., svn or git) to ignore
the following files and directories. Eclipse needs to edit them,
but they should not be submitted.

*.jar
.settings
.classpath
.project
bin/
build/
classes/
# Matches gwtc output in the war directory, e.g. war/com.google.gwt.bikeshed.tree.Tree/
com.google.gwt.*
bikeshed/war/expensesCustomized/
bikeshed/war/expensesScaffold/
bikeshed/war/mail/
bikeshed/war/pagedExpenses/
bikeshed/war/simplecelllist/
bikeshed/war/stocksdesktop/
bikeshed/war/stocksmobile/
bikeshed/war/tree/
bikeshed/war/validation/
appengine-generated/
