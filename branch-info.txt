  -- Format ApiCompatibilityChecker
  -- Big refactoring of test code and api-checker to remove dependencies on
CompilationUnit. This is in preparation for more refactoring, which will make
CompilationUnit stateless outputs rather than stateful inputs/outputs.
  -- TypeOracle now builds from bytecode instead of JDT structures (part of
Instant Hosted Mode work).
  -- Simplify resolution of annotations in TypeOracle. Annotaions must always
use the context classloader, which contains all user data, because that's the
same classloader that Generators run in.  There is also no need to resolve them
since they may be binary-only.
