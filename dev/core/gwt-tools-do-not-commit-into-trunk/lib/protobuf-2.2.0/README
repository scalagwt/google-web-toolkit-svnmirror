This is version 2.2.0 of the Java Protocol Buffer Library. We use protocol buffers
communication protocol between the Development Mode Server and Remote Viewers.

To build this library:

1) Download http://protobuf.googlecode.com/files/protobuf-2.2.0.tar.gz
2) Unzip the archive

3) Follow the "Installation - With Maven" instructions located in java/README.txt.
Note that Maven is not required; one can altenatively follow the
"Installation - Without Maven" instructions.

NOTE: If you decide to use Maven, be sure to add:  

<properties>
    <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>
</properties>

as a child of the <project> tag in the java/pom.xml file. This will prevent 
platform-dependent encoding warnings during the packaging step. See
http://maven.apache.org/general.html#encoding-warning for more information.
