       * </li>
       * 
       * <li><div class="heading">Serialization</div> <div>Java serialization
       * relies on a few mechanisms that are not available in compiled

       * GWT does not support standard Java serialization. Instead, GWT has an

     * Whenever possible, GWT defers to browsers' native user interface

     * <li>An entry point application class name; these are optional, although
     * any module referred to in HTML must have at least one entry-point class
     * specified</li>

     * {@link DeveloperGuide.Fundamentals.ProjectStructure standard project layout}.
     * 
     * <h2>Entry-Point Classes</h2>
     * A module entry-point is any class that is assignable to
     * {@link com.google.gwt.core.client.EntryPoint} and that can be constructed
     * without parameters. When a module is loaded, every entry point class is
     * instantiated and its
     * {@link com.google.gwt.core.client.EntryPoint#onModuleLoad()} method gets
     * called.
     * 
     * <h2>Source Path</h2>
     * Modules can specify which subpackages contain translatable <i>source</i>,
     * causing the named package and its subpackages to be added to the
     * <i>source path</i>. Only files found on the source path are candidates
     * to be translated into JavaScript, making it possible to mix
     * {@link DeveloperGuide.Fundamentals.ClientSide client-side} and
     * {@link DeveloperGuide.Fundamentals.ServerSide server-side} code together
     * in the same classpath without conflict.
     * 
     * <p>
     * When module inherit other modules, their source paths are combined so
     * that each module will have access to the translatable source it requires.
     * </p>
     * 
     * <h2>Public Path</h2>
     * Modules can specify which subpackages are <i>public</i>, causing the
     * named package and its subpackages to be added to the <i>public path</i>.
     * When you compile your application into JavaScript, all the files that can
     * be found on your public path are copied to the module's output directory.
     * The net effect is that user-visible URLs need not include a full package
     * name.
     * 
     * <p>
     * When module inherit other modules, their public paths are combined so
     * that each module will have access to the static resources it expects.
     * </p>

      /**
       * Modules can contain references to external JavaScript and CSS files,
       * causing them to be automatically loaded when the module itself is
       * loaded.
       * 
       * <h2>Injecting External JavaScript</h2>
       * Script injection is a convenient way to automatically associate
       * external JavaScript files with your module. The script injection uses
       * the following syntax:
       * 
       * <pre class="code">
       * &lt;script src="<i>js-url</i>"&gt;&lt;![CDATA[
       *   <i>script ready-function body</i> 
       * ]]&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
       * </pre>
       * 
       * where <i>ready-function body</i> is the body of a JavaScript function
       * that returns <code>true</code> when the script is loaded and is ready
       * for use. The script is loaded into the namespace of the
       * {@link DeveloperGuide.Fundamentals.HostPage host page} as if you had
       * included it explicitly using the HTML <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>
       * element.
       * 
       * 
       * <p>
       * For example, suppose your module relies on a script called
       * <code>InjectedScript.js</code> that looks like this:
       * 
       * {@gwt.include com/google/gwt/examples/module/InjectedScript.js}
       * 
       * Your module might look like this:
       * 
       * {@gwt.include com/google/gwt/examples/module/ScriptInjection.gwt.xml}
       * </p>
       * 
       * <p>
       * The purpose of the ready-function is to determine unambiguously that
       * the script is fully loaded, so that your GWT code can use
       * {@link DeveloperGuide.JavaScriptNativeInterface JSNI} and be sure the
       * referenced identifiers are available. In the example above, the
       * existence of the function <code>bar</code> indicates that the script
       * is ready.
       * </p>
       * 
       * <h2>Injecting External Stylesheets</h2>
       * Stylesheet injection is a convenient way to automatically associate
       * external CSS files with your module. Use the following syntax to cause
       * a CSS file to be automatically attached to the
       * {@link HostPage host page}.
       * 
       * <pre class="code">&lt;stylesheet src="<i>css-url</i>"/&gt;</pre>
       * 
       * You can add any number of stylesheets this way, and the order of
       * inclusion into the page reflects the order in which the elements appear
       * in your module XML.
       * 
       * <h2>Injection and Module Inheritance</h2>
       * Module inheritance makes resource injection particularly convenient. If
       * you wish to create a reusable library that relies upon particular
       * stylesheets or JavaScript files, you can be sure that clients of your
       * library have everything they need automatically by inheriting from your
       * module.
       * 
       * @title Automatic Resource Injection
       * @synopsis Modules can contain references to external JavaScript and CSS

     * Events in GWT use the "listener interface" model similar to other user
     * interface frameworks. A listener interface defines one or more methods
     * that the widget calls to announce an event. A class wishing to receive
     * events of a particular type implements the associated listener interface
     * and then passes a reference to itself to the widget to "subscribe" to a
     * set of events.
     * 
     * <p>

     * 
     * Using anonymous inner classes as in the above example can be inefficient

     * many listener objects. Widgets supply their <code>this</code> pointer
     * as the <code>sender</code> parameter when they invoke a listener
     * method, allowing a single listener to distinguish between multiple event
     * publishers. This makes better use of memory but requires slightly more
     * code, as shown in the following example:
     *

     *

     * Composites are by far the most effective way to create new widgets. You
     * can easily combine groups of existing widgets into a composite that is
     * itself a reusable widget. {@link Composite} is a specialized widget that
     * can contain another component (typically, a
     * {@link com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.Panel panel}) but behaves as if it
     * were its contained widget. Using {@link Composite} is preferable to
     * attempting to create complex widgets by subclassing
     * {@link com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.Panel} because a composite usually
     * wants to control which methods are publicly accessible without exposing
     * those methods that it would inherit from its panel superclass.
     * {@link com.google.gwt.examples.CompositeExample This} is an example of
     * how to create a composite.
     * 
     * <h2>From Scratch in Java code</h2>
     * It is also possible to create a widget from scratch, although it is
     * trickier since you have to write code at a lower level. Many of the basic
     * widgets are written this way, such as {@link Button} and {@link TextBox}.
     * Please refer to the implementations of these widgets to understand how to
     * create your own.
     * 
     * <h2>Using JavaScript</h2>
     * When implementing a custom widget that derives directly from the
     * {@link Widget} base class, you may also write some of the widget's
     * methods using JavaScript. This should generally be done only as a last
     * resort, as it becomes necessary to consider the cross-browser
     * implications of the native methods that you write, and also becomes more
     * difficult to debug. For an example of this pattern in practice, see the

     * <h2>RootPanel</h2>
     * The first panel you're likely to encounter is the
     * {@link com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.RootPanel}. This panel is always at
     * the top of the containment hierarchy. The default RootPanel wraps the
     * HTML document's body, and is obtained by calling
     * {@link com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.RootPanel#get()}. If you need to
     * get a root panel wrapping another element in the HTML document, you can
     * do so using {@link RootPanel#get(String)}.
     * 
     * <h2>CellPanel</h2>
     * {@link com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.CellPanel} is the abstract base
     * class for {@link com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.DockPanel},
     * {@link com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.HorizontalPanel}, and
     * {@link com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.VerticalPanel}. What these panels
     * all have in common is that they position their child widgets within
     * logical "cells". Thus, a child widget can be aligned within the cell that
     * contains it, using
     * {@link com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.CellPanel#setCellHorizontalAlignment setCellHorizontalAlignment()}
     * and
     * {@link com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.CellPanel#setCellVerticalAlignment setCellVerticalAlignment()}.
     * CellPanels also allow you to set the size of the cells themselves
     * (relative to the panel as a whole) using
     * {@link com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.CellPanel#setCellWidth} and
     * {@link com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.CellPanel#setCellHeight}.
     *

     * {@link com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.StackPanel}.
     * 
     * <h2>Sizes and Measures</h2>
     * It is possible to set the size of a widget explicitly using
     * {@link com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.UIObject#setWidth setWidth()},
     * {@link com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.UIObject#setHeight setHeight()},
     * and {@link com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.UIObject#setSize setSize()}.

     * widget's style name is set using
     * {@link com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.UIObject#setStyleName(String) setStyleName()}.
     * For example, the {@link Button} has a default style of
     * <code>gwt-Button</code>. In order to give all buttons a larger font,
     * you could put the following rule in your application's CSS file:
     * 
     * <pre class='code'>.gwt-Button { font-size: 150%; }</pre>
     * 
     * <h2>Complex Styles</h2>
     * <p>
     * Some widgets have somewhat more complex styles associated with them.
     * {@link com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.MenuBar}, for example, has the
     * following styles:
     * </p>
     * 
     * <pre class='code'>
     *   .gwt-MenuBar { the menu bar itself }
     *   .gwt-MenuBar .gwt-MenuItem { menu items }
     *   .gwt-MenuBar .gwt-MenuItem-selected { selected menu items }</pre>
     * 
     * <p>
     * In this example, there are two styles rules that apply to menu items. The
     * first applies to all menu items (both selected and unselected), while the
     * second (with the -selected suffix) applies only to selected menu items. A
     * selected menu item's style name will be set to
     * <code>"gwt-MenuItem gwt-MenuItem-selected"</code>, specifying that
     * both style rules will be applied. The most common way of doing this is to
     * use
     * {@link com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.UIObject#setStyleName(String) setStyleName}
     * to set the base style name, then
     * {@link com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.UIObject#addStyleName(String) addStyleName()}
     * and
     * {@link com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.UIObject#removeStyleName(String) removeStyleName()}
     * to add and remove the second style name.
     * </p>
     * 
     * <h2>CSS Files</h2>
     * <p>
     * Typically, stylesheets are placed in a package that is part of your
     * module's {@link DeveloperGuide.Fundamentals.Modules public path}. Then
     * simply include a reference to the stylesheet in your
     * {@link DeveloperGuide.Fundamentals.HostPage host page}, such as
     * 
     * <pre>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyles.css" type="text/css"&gt;</pre>
     * 
     * </p>
     * 
     * <h2>Documentation</h2>
     * <p>
     * It is standard practice to document the relevant CSS style names for each
     * widget class as part of its doc comment. For a simple example, see
     * {@link com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.Button}. For a more complex

   * the client and server to pass Java objects back and forth over HTTP.
   * 
   * <p>
   * When used properly, RPCs give you the opportunity to move all of your UI
   * logic to the client, resulting in greatly improved performance, reduced
   * bandwidth, reduced web server load, and a pleasantly fluid user experience.
   * </p>
   * 
   * <p>
   * The {@link DeveloperGuide.Fundamentals.ServerSide server-side} code that
   * gets invoked from the client is often referred to as a <i>service</i>, so
   * the act of making a remote procedure call is sometimes referred to as
   * invoking a service. To be clear, though, the term <i>service</i> in this
   * context isn't the same as the more general "web service" concept. In
   * particular, GWT services are not related to the Simple Object Access
   * Protocol (SOAP).

     * To develop a new service interface, begin by creating a
     * {@link DeveloperGuide.Fundamentals.ClientSide client-side} Java interface
     * that extends the {@link com.google.gwt.user.client.rpc.RemoteService} tag
     * interface.
     * 
     * {@example MyService}
     * 
     * This synchronous interface is the definitive version of your service's
     * specification. Any implementation of this service on the
     * {@link DeveloperGuide.Fundamentals.ServerSide server-side} must extend
     * {@link RemoteServiceServlet} and implement this service interface.
     * 
     * {@example MyServiceImpl}
     * 
     * <h2>Asynchronous Interfaces</h2>
     * 
     * Before you can actually attempt to make a remote call from the client,
     * you must create another interface, an asynchronous one, based on your
     * original service interface. Continuing with the example above...
     * 
     * {@example MyServiceAsync}
     * 
     * <p>
     * The nature of asynchronous method calls requires the caller to pass in a
     * callback object that can be notified when an asynchronous call completes,
     * since by definition the caller cannot be blocked until the call
     * completes. For the same reason, asynchronous methods do not have return
     * types; they must always return void. After an asynchronous call is made,
     * all communication back to the caller is via the passed-in callback
     * object.
     * </p>
     * 
     * The relationship between a service interface and its asynchronous
     * counterpart is straightforward:
     * <ul>
     * <li>If a service interface is called
     * <code>com.example.cal.client.SpellingService</code>, then the
     * asynchronous interface must be called
     * <code>com.example.cal.client.SpellingServiceAsync</code>. The
     * asynchronous interface must be in the same package and have the same
     * name, but with the suffix <code>Async</code>.</li>
     * 
     * <li>For each method in your service interface,
     * 
     * {@example #methodName(ParamType1, ParamType2)}
     * 
     * an asynchronous sibling method should be defined that looks like this:
     * 
     * {@example #methodName(ParamType1, ParamType2, AsyncCallback)}
     * 
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * 
     * See {@link AsyncCallback} for additional details on how to implement an
     * asynchronous callback.

     * Method parameters and return types must be <i>serializable</i>, which

     * make serialization as painless as possible, so while the rules regarding
     * serialization are subtle, in practice the behavior becomes intuitive very
     * quickly.
     * 
     * <p>
     * A type is serializable and can be used in a service interface if it
     * <ul>
     * <li>is primitive, such as <code>char</code>, <code>byte</code>,
     * <code>short</code>, <code>int</code>, <code>long</code>,
     * <code>boolean</code>, <code>float</code>, or <code>double</code>;</li>
     * <li>is <code>String</code>, <code>Date</code>, or a primitive
     * wrapper such as <code>Character</code>, <code>Byte</code>,
     * <code>Short</code>, <code>Integer</code>, <code>Long</code>,
     * <code>Boolean</code>, <code>Float</code>, or <code>Double</code>;</li>
     * <li>is an array of serializable types (including other serializable
     * arrays);</li>
     * <li>is a serializable user-defined class; or</li>
     * <li>has at least one serializable subclass</li>
     * </ul>
     * </p>
     * 
     * <h2>Serializable User-defined Classes</h2>
     * A user-defined class is serializable if
     * <ol>
     * <li>it is assignable to
     * {@link com.google.gwt.user.client.rpc.IsSerializable}, either because it
     * directly implements the interface or because it derives from a superclass
     * that does, and </li>
     * <li>all non-<code>transient</code> fields are themselves
     * serializable.</li>
     * </ol>
     * 
     * The <code>transient</code> keyword is honored, so values in transient
     * fields are not exchanged during RPCs. Fields that are declared
     * <code>final</code> are also not exchanged during RPCs, so they should
     * generally be marked <code>transient</code> as well.
     * 
     * <h2>Polymorphism</h2>
     * GWT RPC supports polymorphic parameters and return types. To make the
     * best use of polymorphism, however, you should still try to be as specific
     * as your design allows when defining service interfaces. Increased
     * specificity allows the
     * {@link DeveloperGuide.Fundamentals.JavaToJavaScriptCompiler compiler} to
     * do a better job of removing unnecessary code when it optimizes your
     * application for size reduction.
     * 
     * <h2>Type Arguments</h2>
     * Collection classes such as <code>java.util.Set</code> and
     * <code>java.util.List</code> are tricky because they operate in terms of
     * <code>Object</code> instances. To make collections serializable, you
     * should specify the particular type of objects they are expected to
     * contain. This requires you to use the special Javadoc annotation
     * <code>&#64;gwt.typeArgs</code>. Defining an <i>item type</i> for a
     * collection means that you will ensure that the collection only ever
     * contains objects of that item type or a subclass thereof. This hint is
     * necessary so that the GWT proxy generator can create efficient code.
     * Adding an object to a collection that violates its asserted item type
     * will lead to undefined behavior.
     * 
     * <p>
     * To annotate fields of collection type in a serializable user-defined
     * class:
     * 
     * {@example RemoteProcedureCalls.SerializableTypes.MyClass}
     * 
     * Note that there is no need to specify the name of the field in the
     * <code>&#64;gwt.typeArgs</code> declaration since it can be inferred.
     * </p>
     * 
     * <p>
     * Similarly, to annotate parameters and return types:
     * 
     * {@example RemoteProcedureCalls.SerializableTypes.MyService}
     * 
     * Note that parameter annotations must include the name of the parameter
     * they are annotating in addition to the collection item type, while return

     * services (e.g. SOAP) layer for your application. GWT RPCs, fundamentally,
     * are simply a method of "getting from the client to the server." In other
     * words, you use RPCs to accomplish tasks that are part of your application
     * but that cannot be done on the client computer.

     * <p>

     * </p>
     * 
     * <p>

     * to treat them as your application's entire back end. From this
     * perspective,
     * {@link DeveloperGuide.Fundamentals.ClientSide client-side code} is your
     * "front end" and all service code that runs on the server is "back end."
     * If you take this approach, your service implementations would tend to be
     * more general-purpose APIs that are not tightly coupled to one specific
     * application. Your service definitions would likely directly access
     * databases through JDBC or Hibernate or even files in the server's file
     * system. For many applications, this view is appropriate, and it can be
     * very efficient because it reduces the number of tiers.
     * </p>
     * 
     * <p>
     * In more complex, multi-tiered architectures, your GWT service definitions

     * environments such as J2EE servers. From this perspective, your services
     * can be viewed of as the "server half" of your application's user
     * interface. Instead of being general-purpose, services are created for the

   * GWT includes a special {@link GWTTestCase} base class that provides <a
   * href="http://www.junit.org">JUnit</a> integration. Running a compiled
   * {@link GWTTestCase} subclass under JUnit launches an invisible GWT browser.
   * 
   * <p>
   * By default, tests run in
   * {@link DeveloperGuide.Fundamentals.HostedMode hosted mode} as normal Java
   * bytecode in a JVM. Overriding this default behavior requires passing
   * arguments to the GWT shell. Arguments cannot be passed directly through the
   * command line, because normal command-line arguments go directly to the
   * JUnit runner. Instead, define the system property <code>gwt.args</code>
   * to pass arguments to GWT. For example, to run in
   * {@link DeveloperGuide.Fundamentals.WebMode web mode}, declare
   * <code>-Dgwt.args="-web"</code> as a JVM argument when invoking JUnit. To
   * get a full list of supported options, declare
   * <code>-Dgwt.args="-help"</code> (instead of running the test, help is
   * printed to the console).
   * </p>
   * 
   * <h2>Creating a Test Case</h2>
   * <p>
   * GWT includes a handy
   * {@link DeveloperGuide.Fundamentals.CommandLineTools.junitCreator} tool that
   * will generate a starter test case for you, plus scripts for testing in both
   * hosted mode and web mode. But here are the steps if you want to set it up
   * by hand:
   * </p>
   * <ol>
   * <li>Define a class that extends {@link GWTTestCase}.</li>
   * <li>Create a {@link DeveloperGuide.Fundamentals.Modules module} that
   * causes the source for your test case to be included. If you are adding a
   * test case to an existing GWT app, you can usually just use the existing
   * module.</li>
   * <li>Implement the method {@link GWTTestCase#getModuleName()} to return the
   * fully-qualified name of the module. </li>
   * <li>Compile your test case class to bytecode (using <a
   * href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/tooldocs/windows/javac.html">javac</a>
   * or a Java IDE).</li>
   * <li>When running the test case, make sure your classpath includes:
   * 
   * <ul>
   * <li>your project's <code>src</code> directory</li>
   * <li>your project's <code>bin</code> directory</li>
   * <li><code>gwt-user.jar</code></li>
   * <li><code>gwt-dev-windows.jar</code> (or <code>gwt-dev-linux.jar</code>)</li>
   * <li><code>junit.jar</code></li>
   * </ul>
   * 
   * </li>
   * </ol>
   * 
   * <p>
   * <h2>Example</h2>
   * Write the <code>com.example.foo.client.FooTest</code> test case.
   * 
   * {@example com.example.foo.client.FooTest}
   * 
   * Create the <code>com.example.foo.Foo</code> module.

   *      module.

  public static class JUnitIntegration {

    /**
     * GWT's <a href="http://www.junit.org">JUnit</a> integration provides
     * special support for testing functionality that cannot execute in
     * straight-line code. For example, you might want to make an
     * {@link DeveloperGuide.RemoteProcedureCalls RPC} call to a server and then
     * validate the response. However, in a normal JUnit test run, the test
     * stops as soon as the test method returns control to the caller, and GWT
     * does not support multiple threads or blocking. To support this use case,
     * {@link GWTTestCase} has extended the <code>TestCase</code> API.
     * 
     * <p>
     * The two key methods are {@link GWTTestCase#delayTestFinish(int)} and
     * {@link GWTTestCase#finishTest()}. Calling <code>delayTestFinish()</code>
     * during a test method's execution puts that test in asynchronous mode,
     * which means the test will not finish when the test method returns control
     * to the caller. Instead, a <i>delay period</i> begins, which lasts the
     * amount of time specified in the call to <code>delayTestFinish()</code>.
     * During the delay period, the test system will wait for one of three
     * things to happen:
     * 
     * <ol>
     * <li> If <code>finishTest()</code> is called before the delay period
     * expires, the test will succeed.</li>
     * <li> If any exception escapes from an event handler during the delay
     * period, the test will error with the thrown exception.</li>
     * <li> If the delay period expires and neither of the above has happened,
     * the test will error with a
     * {@link com.google.gwt.junit.client.TimeoutException}. </li>
     * </ol>
     * </p>
     * 
     * <p>
     * The normal use pattern is to setup an event in the test method and call
     * <code>delayTestFinish()</code> with a timeout significantly longer than
     * the event is expected to take. The event handler validates the event and
     * then calls <code>finishTest()</code>.
     * </p>

     * next event. When the last event fires, call <code>finishTest()</code>
     * as normal. </li>
     * <li> Set a counter containing the number of events to wait for. As each
     * event comes in, decrement the counter. Call <code>finishTest()</code>

  /**
   * GWT includes a flexible set of tools to help you internationalize your
   * applications and libraries. GWT internationalization support provides a
   * variety of techniques to internationalize strings, typed values, and
   * classes.
   * 
   * <h2>Getting Started</h2>
   * Since GWT supports a variety of ways of internationalizing your code, begin
   * by researching which approach best matches your development requirements.
   * 
   * <p>
   * <b>Are you writing code from scratch?</b> <br/>If so, you'll probably want
   * to read up on GWT's
   * {@link com.google.gwt.doc.DeveloperGuide.Internationalization.StaticStringInternationalization static string internationalization}
   * techniques.
   * </p>
   * 
   * <p>
   * <b>Do you want to internationalize mostly settings or end-user messages?</b>
   * <br/> If you have mostly settings (the kind of thing for which you'd
   * normally use simple properties files), consider
   * {@link com.google.gwt.i18n.client.Constants}. If you have a lot a of
   * end-user messages, then {@link com.google.gwt.i18n.client.Messages} is
   * probably what you want.
   * </p>
   * 
   * <p>
   * <b>Do you have existing localized properties files you'd like to reuse?</b>
   * <br/> The
   * {@link com.google.gwt.doc.DeveloperGuide.Fundamentals.CommandLineTools.i18nCreator i18nCreator tool}
   * can automatically generate interfaces that extend either
   * {@link com.google.gwt.i18n.client.Constants} or
   * {@link com.google.gwt.i18n.client.Messages}.
   * </p>
   * 
   * <p>
   * <b>Are you adding GWT functionality to an existing web application that
   * already has a localization process defined?</b> <br/>
   * {@link com.google.gwt.i18n.client.Dictionary} will help you interoperate
   * with existing pages without requiring you to use
   * {@link com.google.gwt.doc.DeveloperGuide.Internationalization.SpecifyingLocale GWT's concept of locale}.
   * </p>
   * 
   * <p>
   * <b>Do you really just want a simple way to get properties files down to the
   * client regardless of localization?</b> <br/> You can do that, too. Try
   * using {@link com.google.gwt.i18n.client.Constants} without
   * {@link com.google.gwt.doc.DeveloperGuide.Internationalization.SpecifyingLocale specifying a locale}.
   * </p>
   * 
   * <h2>Internationalization Techniques</h2>
   * GWT offers multiple internationalization techniques to afford maximum
   * flexibility to GWT developers and to make it possible to design for
   * efficiency, maintainability, flexibility, and interoperability in whichever
   * combinations are most useful.
   * 
   * <p>
   * {@link com.google.gwt.doc.DeveloperGuide.Internationalization.StaticStringInternationalization Static string internationalization}
   * refers to a family of efficient and type-safe techniques that rely on
   * strongly-typed Java interfaces,
   * {@link com.google.gwt.doc.DeveloperGuide.Internationalization.PropertiesFiles properties files},
   * and code generation to provide locale-aware messages and configuration
   * settings. These techniques depend on the interfaces
   * {@link com.google.gwt.i18n.client.Constants} and
   * {@link com.google.gwt.i18n.client.Messages}.
   * </p>
   * 
   * <p>
   * At the other end of the spectrum,
   * {@link com.google.gwt.doc.DeveloperGuide.Internationalization.DynamicStringInternationalization dynamic string internationalization}
   * is a simplistic and flexible technique for looking up localized values
   * defined in a module's
   * {@link com.google.gwt.doc.DeveloperGuide.Fundamentals.HostPage host page}
   * without needing to recompile your application. This technique is supported
   * by the class {@link com.google.gwt.i18n.client.Dictionary}.
   * </p>
   * 
   * <p>
   * Using an approach similar to static string internationalization, GWT also
   * supports internationalizing sets of algorithms using locale-sensitive type
   * substitution. This is an advanced technique that you probably will not need
   * to use directly, although it is useful for implementing complex
   * internationalized libraries. For details on this technique, see
   * {@link com.google.gwt.i18n.client.Localizable}.
   * </p>
   * 
   * <h2>The I18N Module</h2>
   * The core types related to internationalization reside in the
   * <code>com.google.gwt.i18n</code> package:
   * 
   * <ul>
   * <li>{@link com.google.gwt.i18n.client.Constants} <div>Useful for
   * localizing typed constant values</div></li>
   * <li>{@link com.google.gwt.i18n.client.Messages} <div>Useful for localizing
   * messages requiring arguments</div></li>
   * <li>{@link com.google.gwt.i18n.client.ConstantsWithLookup} <div>Like
   * {@link com.google.gwt.i18n.client.Constants} but with extra lookup
   * flexibility for highly data-driven applications</div></li>
   * <li>{@link com.google.gwt.i18n.client.Dictionary} <div>Useful when adding
   * a GWT module to existing localized web pages</div> </li>
   * <li>{@link com.google.gwt.i18n.client.Localizable} <div>Useful for
   * localizing algorithms encapsulated in a class</div> </li>
   * </ul>
   * 
   * <p>
   * The GWT internationalization types are included in the module
   * <code>com.google.gwt.i18n.I18N</code>. To use any of these types, your
   * module must inherit from it:
   * 
   * {@gwt.include com/google/gwt/examples/i18n/InheritsExample.gwt.xml}

   * @childIntro Specifics
   */
  public static class Internationalization {

    /**
     * Static string localization relies on code generation from
     * {@link DeveloperGuide.Internationalization.PropertiesFiles properties files}.
     * GWT supports static string localization through two tag interfaces (that
     * is, interfaces having no methods that represent a functionality contract)
     * and a code generation library to generate implementations of those
     * interfaces.
     * 
     * <p>
     * For example, if you wanted to localize the constant strings "hello,
     * world" and "goodbye, world" in your GWT application, you could define an
     * interface that abstracts those strings by extending the built-in
     * <code>Constants</code> interface:
     * 
     * {@example com.google.gwt.examples.i18n.MyConstants}
     * 
     * Now create an associated default properties file called
     * <code>MyConstants.properties</code> in the same package:
     * 
     * {@gwt.include com/google/gwt/examples/i18n/MyConstants.properties}
     * 
     * You can also create a localized translation for each supported locale in
     * separate properties file. In this case, we localize for Spanish:
     * 
     * {@gwt.include com/google/gwt/examples/i18n/MyConstants_es.properties}
     * 
     * To use the internationalized constants, you create an implementation of
     * <code>MyConstants</code> using {@link GWT#create(Class)}:
     * 
     * {@example com.google.gwt.examples.i18n.MyConstantsExample#useMyConstants()}
     * </p>
     * 
     * <h2>The Benefits of Static String Internationalization</h2>
     * As you can see from the example above, static internationalization relies
     * on a very tight binding between internationalized code and its localized
     * resources. Using explicit method calls in this way has a number of
     * advantages. The GWT compiler can optimize deeply, removing uncalled
     * methods and inlining localized strings -- making generated code as
     * efficient as if the strings had been hard-coded.
     * 
     * <p>
     * The value of compile-time checking becomes even more apparent when
     * applied to messages that take multiple arguments. Creating a Java method
     * for each message allows the compiler to check both the number and types
     * of arguments supplied by the calling code against the message template
     * defined in a properties file. For example, attempting to use this
     * interface:
     * 
     * {@example com.google.gwt.examples.i18n.ErrorMessages}
     * 
     * with this properties file:
     * 
     * {@gwt.include com/google/gwt/examples/i18n/ErrorMessages.properties}
     * 
     * results in a compile-time error because the message template in the
     * properties file expects three arguments, while the
     * <code>permissionDenied</code> method can only supply two.
     * </p>
     * 
     * <h2>Which Interface to Use?</h2>
     * Extend <code>{@link com.google.gwt.i18n.client.Constants}</code> to
     * create a collection of constant values of a variety of types that can be
     * accessed by calling methods (called <i>constant accessors</i>) on an
     * interface. Constant accessors may return a variety of types, including
     * strings, numbers, booleans, and even maps. A compile-time check is done
     * to ensure that the value in a properties file matches the return type
     * declared by its corresponding constant accessor. In other words, if a
     * constant accessor is declared to return an <code>int</code>, its
     * associated property is guaranteed to be a valid <code>int</code> value --
     * avoiding a potential source of runtime errors.
     * 
     * <p>
     * <code>{@link com.google.gwt.i18n.client.ConstantsWithLookup}</code> is
     * identical to <code>Constants</code> except that the interface also
     * includes a method to look up strings by property name, which facilitates
     * dynamic binding to constants by name at runtime.
     * <code>ConstantsWithLookup</code> can sometimes be useful in highly
     * data-driven applications. One caveat: <code>ConstantsWithLookup</code>
     * is less efficient than <code>Constants</code> because the compiler
     * cannot discard unused constant methods, resulting in larger applications.
     * </p>
     * 
     * <p>
     * Extend <code>{@link com.google.gwt.i18n.client.Messages}</code> to
     * create a collection of formatted messages that can accept parameters. You
     * might think of the <code>Messages</code> interface as a statically
     * verifiable equivalent of the traditional Java combination of
     * <code>Properties</code>, <code>ResourceBundle</code>, and
     * <code>MessageFormat</code> rolled into a single mechanism.
     * </p>
     * 
     * <h2>Properties Files</h2>
     * All of the types above use properties files based on the traditional <a
     * href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html#load(java.io.InputStream)">Java
     * properties file format</a>, although GWT uses
     * {@link DeveloperGuide.Internationalization.PropertiesFiles an enhanced properties file format}
     * that are encoded as UTF-8 and can therefore contain Unicode characters
     * directly.

     * 
     * <p>
     * If that sounded like gibberish (and it probably did), a quick digression
     * into the purpose of client properties is in order...
     * </p>
     * 
     * <h2>Client Properties and the GWT Compilation Process</h2>
     * <i>Client properties</i> are key/value pairs that can be used to
     * configure GWT modules. User agent, for example, is represented by a
     * client property. Each client property can have any number of values, but
     * all of the values must be enumerable when the GWT compiler runs.
     * 
     * <p>
     * GWT modules can define and extend the set of available client properties
     * along with the potential values each property might assume when loaded in
     * an end user's browser. At compile time, the GWT compiler determines all
     * the possible permutations of a module's client properties, from which it
     * produces multiple <i>compilations</i>. Each compilation is optimized for
     * a different set of client properties and is recorded into a file ending
     * with the suffix <code>.cache.html</code>.
     * </p>
     * 
     * <p>
     * In deployment, the end-user's browser only needs one particular
     * compilation, which is determined by mapping the end user's client
     * properties onto the available compiled permutations. Thus, only the exact
     * code required by the end user is downloaded, no more. By making locale a
     * client property, the standard startup process in <code>gwt.js</code>
     * chooses the appropriate localized version of an application, providing
     * ease of use (it's easier than it might sound!), optimized performance,
     * and minimum script size.
     * </p>
     * 
     * <h2>The Default Locale</h2>
     * The <code>com.google.gwt.i18n.I18N</code> module defines only one
     * locale by default, called <code>default</code>. This default locale is
     * used when the <code>locale</code> client property goes unspecified in
     * deployment. The default locale is used internally as a last-resort match
     * between a {@link com.google.gwt.i18n.client.Localizable} interface and a
     * localized resource or class.
     * 
     * <h2>Adding Locale Choices to a Module</h2>
     * In any real-world application, you will define at least one locale in
     * addition to the default locale. "Adding a locale" means extending the set
     * of values of the <code>locale</code> client property using the
     * <code>&lt;extend-property&gt;</code> element in your
     * {@link com.google.gwt.doc.DeveloperGuide.Fundamentals.Modules.ModuleXml module XML}.
     * 
     * <p>
     * For example, the following module adds multiple locale values:
     * 
     * {@gwt.include com/google/gwt/examples/i18n/MyAppWithLocales.gwt.xml}
     * </p>
     * 
     * 
     * <h2>Choosing a Locale at Runtime</h2>
     * The locale client property can be specified using either a meta tag or as
     * part of the query string in the host page's URL. If both are specified,
     * the query string takes precedence.
     * 
     * <p>
     * To specify the <code>locale</code> client property using a meta tag in
     * the
     * {@link com.google.gwt.doc.DeveloperGuide.Fundamentals.HostPage host page},
     * embed a meta tag for <code>gwt:property</code> as follows:
     * 
     * <pre>&lt;meta name="gwt:property" content="locale=x_Y"&gt;</pre>
     * 
     * For example, the following host HTML page sets the locale to "ja_JP":
     * 
     * {@gwt.include com/google/gwt/examples/i18n/ColorNameLookupExample_ja_JP.html}
     * </p>
     * 
     * <p>
     * To specify the <code>locale</code> client property using a query
