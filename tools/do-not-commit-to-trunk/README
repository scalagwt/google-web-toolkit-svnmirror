The purpose of this temporary directory is to hold the HtmlUnit jars while
we upgrade to HtmlUnit-2.7 and beyond, and revisit all the Gwt tests that are
currently ignored on HtmlUnit.

The htmlunit jar names are to be removed of all identifying information because
we don't want multiple copies. 

For updating HtmlUnit, here is the algorithm to use (vetted by HtmlUnit
committers): 

* Check the main Cl page (http://build.canoo.com/htmlunit/). Find the last
build that was successful. Find the svn revision (click on the "XML Log File"
tab, and scroll down to the last "revision" XML tag. search for <revision>).
Download the htmlunit.jar, htmlunit-sources.jar and htmlunit-core-js.jar (and
other dependencies if they have changed) from the artifacts page. Note that
SNAPSHOT artifacts only get generated if all unit tests pass. So the artifacts
correspond to the last successful build. 

* Download the htmlunit-core-js-sources.jar from 
http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net/m2-repo-snapshots/net/sourceforge/htmlunit/htmlunit-core-js/2.7-SNAPSHOT/  
(verify that the core-js.jar are the same as in the previous step).
